# POWERBI_DASHBOARD 
power bi project:
I have done a mini project based on GLOBAL SUPER STORE dataset using power bi. We know that power bi is data visualisation and buisness intelligent tool by microsoft that convert data from diffrent source to create various buisness intelligent report.This report make easy to analyse trend,patterns,track performance and amke data-driven descions.
introduction:
The project aims to analyse the Global superstore dataset using power bi.the dataset contain th excel file contain three tables ie,orders,people,returns.focusing on key meteics like total sale,total profit,mode of shipment most of the customer choose,and shipment year over year comparison,regional sales etc,through data visualisation,gives meaning full insight tn to improve marketing,product were mostly purchased,and geographic patterns to inform descision making and optimize buisness strategies for beter future outcome.
data collection:
data global super store is a excel file https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ez8RhO1rE2QikfdddOZ19eEZhN4r6eW7WHb9qB05T7E/edit?usp=sharing.we can connect data set from 99+ source in power bi.
data cleaning:
data cleaning or data preprocessing are one of the vital procedure for data visualisation,this ensure the dataset more accurate by removing unwanted rows,columns,check datatype of column to ensure each colum occure correct datatypes,append and merge table if you need. power query editor is a ETN tool means extract,transform and note the data.and make the dataset more clean than before and make ready for data visualisation.m language is used i power query, In the Global super store contain 3 primary tables:orders(fact table),poeple and returns(dimension tale).
data modelling:
data modeling of data set one of the major step ,it makes relationship betweeen tables by using common column.most of the time power bi do automatically,some times did by mannually.in this data set order column connect to poeple column by region column.
dashboard layout:
1:overview of total_sale,total_profit,product,customers,country,average shipping days,average discount etc 2:area chart:total profit by country 3:funnel chart:total_sale by market,shipping cost by ship mode 4:clustered colum chart:total returns bycountry 5:tree map:shipping cost by country 6:clusterd column chart:sales and profit by country 7:donut chart:sale by category 8:pie chart:sale by region,total customers and shipping mode by shipping cost 9:map:sale by country and region 10:guage:total returns
project overview:
the project global super store adopts a holistic approach,commencing with rigourous data cleaning for enhance readability.visual representation are intelligently segmented by country region total sale,total profit,ship mode,ship cost.over data visualisation adding table view format for each insights.in depth,shipping analysis delivers into preference accross diffrent ship mode,these comprehensive understanding revealing trends and pattern,improve marketing,make data driven desisions.further more,the project features detaild visualisation focusing on shipping and producr matrices,enriching the analytical depth of exploration it enables product development,when it time to pull one product off the market and replace it with a newer one and more successful one. the dashboard offer comprehensive insight into sales,product,shipment,market by region,country,segment.the insight gives meaningfull information abput the data set global super store and enlight preparation to be taken for better outcomes. data and produce reports using Power BI to give you consistent reporting. If the data is delivered in a graphical manner each time, it is less stressful for the managers, and takes less time to find insights from it, and the organization may find it helpful to predict information. Additionally, it enables you to carry out targeted marketing initiatives that are guaranteed to be effective.
